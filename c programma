What is c programming?
C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

Why we need to learn c programming?
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python


Programma:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello Sheela!");
  return 0;
}

(save filename.c)

explaintaion on programma:

Line 1: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, such as printf() (used in line 4). 
Header files add functionality to C programs.

Note: Don't worry if you don't understand how  #include <stdio.h> works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.

Line 2: A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.

Line 3: Another thing that always appear in a C program is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

Line 4: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example, it will output "Hello World!".

Note: Every C statement ends with a semicolon ;

Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:
int main(){printf("Hello Sheela!");return 0;}

Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.

Line 5: return 0 ends the main() function.

Line 6: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
